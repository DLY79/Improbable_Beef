# Improbable Beef - Belly Button Bacteria Dashboard  

# Summary  
The purpose of this assignment was to present the findings of bacteria samples taken from the navels of test subjects.  The samples were analysed and returned the various bacteria found in each test subject.  To protect their identities, each participant was assigned an ID number.  Our job was to present a dashboard that presented the data visually.  Using a drop down menu, users can select a study participant and see which cultures were present in their belly buttons.  The returned visuals include demographic information, a bar chart featuring the top 10 cultures found, a gauge indicating frequency of scrubbing, and finally, a bubble chart that includes all bacteria present, with bubble sizes correlating to amount of bacteria present.  

# Results  
All charts work properly and response time is quick.  Users are able to get a quick view of the bacteria they have in their belly buttons.  They can hover over the bubbles to determine the name of the bacteria.
